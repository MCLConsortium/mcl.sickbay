# 👩‍⚕️ MCL Sickbay

"MCL Sickbay" is the data model and object-relational mapping for the clinical data application of the [Consortium for Molecular and Cellular Characterization of Screen-Detected Lesions](https://mcl.nci.nih.gov/).


## 🏃‍♀️ Getting Started

The "Sickbay" software provides a [Python](https://python.org/) based API into a data model (a series of related classes) and takes advantage of [SQLAlchemy](https://www.sqlalchemy.org/) as the object-relational mapper. This section will help you get started.


### 📀 The Database

For this project, we're using [PostgreSQL](https://www.postgresql.org). You can create a PostgreSQL database to use with this software as follows:

```console
dropdb --if-exists clinical_data
dropuser --if-exists mcl

createuser \
    --createdb \
    --inherit \
    --login \
    --no-createrole \
    --no-superuser \
    mcl


createdb --encoding=UTF8 --owner=mcl clinical_data
```


### 🖥 The Software

To use this software, simply add `mcl.sickbay` as a dependency to your project or install it into your Python virtual environment.

You can develop, build, and test the package locally as follows:

```console
python3 bootstrap.py
bin/buildout
bin/test
```

You can run `bin/create-demo-db` to populate a PostgreSQL database with the schema of the Sickbay data model. Add ``-add-test-data`` to include some test data.

To publish this software, try [Twine](https://twine.readthedocs.io/).


### 🔢 Versioning

We use the [SemVer](https://semver.org/) philosophy for versioning this software. For versions available, see the [release history](https://pypi.org/project/mcl.sickbay/#history).
